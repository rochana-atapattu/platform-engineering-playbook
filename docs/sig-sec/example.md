As the security experts in the Platform Engineering Team, your role within the SIG-Sec (Security Special Interest Group) is to define and implement a robust security framework for our organization's projects. One effective approach is to establish a tiered security model that allows projects to incrementally improve their security posture based on predefined difficulty levels.

Here's an example scenario:

In the tiered security model, you can define three levels of security: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level represents an increasing level of security practices and measures. Projects within the organization can aim to achieve these levels incrementally, starting from the Basic level and progressing towards the Advanced level.

At the Basic level, projects are expected to implement foundational security practices such as secure coding guidelines, proper authentication and access controls, and basic vulnerability scanning. This level ensures a baseline level of security across all projects.

As projects mature and demonstrate adherence to the Basic level requirements, they can progress to the Intermediate level. At this level, projects are expected to implement additional security measures such as secure network configurations, secure data storage, and regular security assessments. This level enhances the overall security posture of the projects and reduces potential vulnerabilities.

Finally, the Advanced level represents the highest level of security within the tiered model. Projects at this level have implemented advanced security measures such as multi-factor authentication, advanced threat detection and response capabilities, and robust incident response procedures. Achieving the Advanced level demonstrates a strong commitment to security and ensures a high level of protection against sophisticated threats.

By implementing this tiered security model, projects can incrementally improve their security practices, ensuring that security measures align with the project's complexity and criticality. The SIG-Sec plays a crucial role in defining the criteria for each level, providing guidance, conducting security reviews, and assisting projects in reaching their desired security level.

This approach not only provides a clear roadmap for projects to follow but also ensures a consistent and standardized approach to security across the organization. It fosters a culture of continuous improvement and empowers project teams to prioritize security and make informed decisions to protect our systems and data.
