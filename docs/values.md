## Platform Engineering Team Values

As members of the Platform Engineering Team, we adhere to the following values, which shape our mindset and influence our actions:

## Ownership and Accountability

We take ownership of our work and hold ourselves accountable for the outcomes. We embrace responsibility for the success of the platform and strive for excellence in everything we do. We take pride in delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of our users and stakeholders.

## Collaboration and Communication

We believe that collaboration and effective communication are essential for building a strong platform and fostering a cohesive team. We actively seek diverse perspectives, share knowledge, and engage in open and respectful discussions. We value active listening, empathy, and clarity in our communication to ensure effective collaboration across teams.

## Continuous Learning and Improvement

We are committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, tools, and industry trends. We embrace a growth mindset and actively seek opportunities to expand our knowledge and skills. We continuously improve our processes, methodologies, and infrastructure to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our platform.

## Innovation and Creativity

We encourage innovation and creativity in our approach to problem-solving and platform development. We foster an environment that values and rewards new ideas, experimentation, and calculated risk-taking. We embrace a culture of innovation to drive forward-thinking solutions and push the boundaries of what is possible.

## Inclusivity and Respect

We believe in creating an inclusive and respectful environment where everyone feels welcome, valued, and heard. We celebrate diversity and actively promote an atmosphere of respect, fairness, and equality. We recognize the power of different perspectives and experiences in driving innovation and fostering a collaborative team culture.

## Trust and Integrity

We foster trust within our team and with our stakeholders by acting with integrity and transparency. We honor commitments, maintain confidentiality, and demonstrate professionalism in our interactions. We build trust through open and honest communication, reliable delivery of our responsibilities, and a focus on building long-term relationships.

By embracing these values, we cultivate a culture of excellence, collaboration, and innovation within the Platform Engineering Team. These values guide our actions, decisions, and interactions as we work together to build and maintain a robust and reliable platform for our organization.

## Automation over process

Large projects have a lot of hard yet less exciting work. We value time spent automating repetitive work more highly than toil. Where work cannot be automated, our culture recognizes and rewards all types of contributions while recognizing that heroism is not sustainable.

## Inclusive is better than exclusive

Broadly successful and useful technologies require different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment. Community membership is a privilege, not a right. Community members earn leadership through effort, scope, quality, quantity, and duration of contributions. Our community respects the time and effort put into a discussion, regardless of where a contributor is on their growth path.

## Evolution is better than stagnation

Openness to new ideas and studied technological evolution make a stronger project. Continual improvement, servant leadership, mentorship, and respect are the foundations of our culture. Our community leaders have a duty to find, sponsor, and promote new community members. Leaders should expect to step aside. Community members should expect to step up.
