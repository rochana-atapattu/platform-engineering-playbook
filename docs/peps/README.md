# Platform Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

A Platform Enhancement Proposal (PEP) is a mechanism we use to propose, communicate, and coordinate new efforts and enhancements for our platform engineering project. PEPs provide a structured approach to discuss and document ideas, ensuring clarity and alignment among contributors. This process is designed to drive collaboration, facilitate decision-making, and create a historical record of our platform's evolution.

Please note that our PEP process is tailored to our specific project requirements and is inspired by the Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) process. While we have adapted the process to suit our needs, we still follow the same principles of open communication and collective decision-making.

## Getting Started with PEPs

1. Socialize your idea with a sponsoring SIG or relevant stakeholders. This can be done through discussions in SIG meetings, mailing lists, or dedicated forums.
2. Follow the PEP process outlined in the [PEP template](docs/pep-template.md). The template provides guidance on the structure and content expected in a PEP, including sections for problem statement, proposed solution, impact assessment, and implementation details.
3. Collaborate with the community by seeking feedback, addressing concerns, and incorporating suggestions from stakeholders.
4. Once your PEP is complete, submit it for review and approval. The PEP review process involves designated reviewers and approvers who evaluate the proposal based on its technical merit, alignment with project goals, and overall impact.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Do I have to use the PEP process for every enhancement?

In general, we encourage the use of the PEP process for substantial enhancements, new features, and changes that have wide-ranging impacts on the platform. However, the decision to use the PEP process ultimately depends on the specific requirements and guidelines set by each SIG or relevant stakeholders. It is essential to engage with the community and seek input to determine when it is appropriate to propose a PEP.

### Why should I use the PEP process?

The PEP process provides several benefits to both contributors and the overall project:

- **Clear Communication**: PEPs ensure that new efforts and enhancements are communicated effectively to the platform engineering community. They serve as a central repository of proposals, making it easier for contributors to track ongoing discussions, decisions, and the progress of each PEP.
- **Structured Decision-Making**: By following the PEP process, we establish a clear framework for decision-making. Approvers and reviewers can evaluate proposals based on their technical merits, alignment with project goals, and potential impact on the platform.
- **Historical Record**: PEPs create a historical record of the platform's evolution. They provide insights into the rationale behind design decisions, the evolution of features, and the overall direction of the project.

### Where should I submit my PEP?

Most PEPs should be submitted to the relevant SIG or working group responsible for the area in which the enhancement is proposed. However, if you are uncertain about the appropriate destination for your PEP, you can reach out to the SIG Architecture team for guidance.

### What does the number at the beginning of the PEP name signify?

PEPs are now prefixed with a unique identifier, typically associated with a tracking issue number. This identifier helps differentiate between PEPs and provides an easy way to locate the corresponding issue where the current state of the PEP is being updated.

### Can I propose changes to the PEP process?

Absolutely! The PEP process is continuously evolving, and we welcome proposals to improve it. If you have suggestions or want to propose changes to the PEP process, you can open a pull request on the PEP-0000 document with your proposal. The community and SIG Architecture team will review and consider your suggestions.
