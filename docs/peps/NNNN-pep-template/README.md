### Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

Answer the following questions related to the production readiness of your proposal.

#### Feature Enablement and Rollback

- How can this feature be enabled/disabled in a live cluster?
  - Feature gate:
    - Feature gate name:
    - Components depending on the feature gate:
  - Other:
    - Describe the mechanism:
    - Will enabling/disabling the feature require downtime of the control plane?
    - Will enabling/disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning of a node?
- Does enabling the feature change any

 default behavior?
- Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e., can we roll back the enablement)?
- What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?
- Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

#### Rollout, Upgrade, and Rollback Planning

- How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?
- What specific metrics should inform a rollback?
- Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?
- Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

#### Monitoring Requirements

- How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?
- How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?
  - Events:
    - Event Reason:
  - API .status:
    - Condition name:
    - Other field:
  - Other (treat as last resort):
    - Details:
- What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?
- What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?
  - Metrics:
    - Metric name:
      - [Optional] Aggregation method:
    - Components exposing the metric:
  - Other (treat as last resort):
    - Details:
- Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

#### Dependencies

- Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

#### Scalability

- Will enabling/using this feature result in any new API calls?
- Will enabling/using this feature result in introducing new API types?
- Will enabling/using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?
- Will enabling/using this feature result in increasing the size or count of the existing API objects?
- Will enabling/using this feature result in increasing the time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?
- Will enabling/using this feature result in a non-negligible increase in resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, etc.) in any components?
- Can enabling/using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

#### Troubleshooting

- How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?
- What are other known failure modes?
- What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?
