## Background:

Traditionally, Developers and Operations were two distinct entities, often resulting in inefficiencies. DevOps was a step towards unifying these roles, but this union led to an overburdening of responsibilities. This is where the Platform Engineering approach shines - it aims to alleviate some of these burdens by standardizing tools and processes across teams. 

## Understanding Platform Engineering:

Platform Engineers primarily manage non-functional requirements such as version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, runtime environments, logging, monitoring, and security. They operate the admin side of essential tools like GitLab, Kubernetes, Jenkins, etc., thereby reducing the cognitive load on application developers, who only need to utilize the user side of these tools. 

## Advantages of a Platform Engineering Team:

A well-structured Platform Engineering team can become the core unit of expertise within our DevOps framework. By overseeing the operation and administration of tools used by the application teams, they can free up these teams to focus more on feature development and release. In essence, the Platform Engineering team creates a platform-as-a-service model for internal developer teams, ensuring security, consistency, and proper tool configuration.

## Adopting an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Model:

By adopting an IDP model, the Platform Engineering team can create a user-friendly interface on top of pre-configured tools, allowing application teams to independently access the services they require. The IDP hides the complexity of managing these services, maintaining the flexibility and speed of DevOps without adding unnecessary operational burdens on the application teams.

## Flexibility and Adaptability:

A Platform Engineering team doesn't restrict teams to specific tools. Instead, it standardizes, configures, and integrates tools into the platform for all teams to utilize. The team can also accommodate requests for new tools, ensuring that they are set up and configured according to best practices before integration. 

## Embracing Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

IaC tools like Terraform, Ansible, or Pulumi are crucial for our IDP. They allow platform engineers to create templates with best practice configurations. These templates can be used to automate the provisioning of resources, providing a balance of automation, self-service, and flexibility.

## Conclusion:

Platform Engineering is an enhancement to our existing DevOps model rather than a regression to old methods. By maintaining flexibility, increasing efficiency, standardizing and automating tool operation, and providing self-service options, we can make our DevOps practices more effective.

Our approach should not only encompass technological shifts but also focus on fostering a culture of collaboration and efficiency. By implementing this proposal, we will effectively distribute responsibilities, maximize expertise, and advance our DevOps practices, making us more adaptable to the increasing complexity of our projects.
